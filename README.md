# Exeblocker

Exeblocker is a program written in C++ that uses the Windows API to block exes from running in memory. It was born from stopping memory-hogging processes from slowing down an
old laptop of mine! You can list the exes you wish to block and it will stop them from running.

# Features

- Customise block list

# TODO

Add a better UI and potentially migrate the program to use a GUI


# Getting Started

Just download the file from releases and run, or feel free to compile the code from source!
